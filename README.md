## description
An application developed by students of the Hackathon Best Hacking League (BHL). 
The application was created to motivate people to take care of our planet together through a ranking social game of cleaning our mother earth. The game consists in placing markers on the map in places of illegal landfill sites. Other participants of the game can locate the marked sites and decide which ones they want to clean. Verification of cleaned places is also carried out by users of the application. For each activity performed in the application, the user gains points, which can be exchanged for prizes. 
Show which stake you can clean today.

## innovation
According to [site](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Waste_statistics/pl "Git").  In 2016, 5 tons of waste per capita was produced in the EU. 
Certainly, a large amount of this waste found its place in illegal waste dumps. 
The actions of cleaning up the world and the like are extremely important in today's world, but unfortunately they are not enough. 
The application aims to encourage more frequent cleaning of the world through competition.

## functionalities
* reporting of illegal landfill sites
* cleaning of the reported locations
* scoring
* competition

## comfort
* automatic location downloading
* pictures of illegal dumps
* verification of tidied up places by users
* navigating to the marked places 

## stage of implementation
We estimate that the application has been completed in about 25%. There is no in-depth code refactoring. 
The way of assigning points for each action performed by the user was also refined.
The ranking does not fully work. The project created by us can be evaluated as an outline of the application aimed at combating planetary litter.

## business and development potential
* exchange of the points earned for discounts from sponsors
* establishing cooperation with pro-environmental institutions
* promoting environmental protection by informing users about environmental actions
* adding a leaflet on waste segregation to the application

## method of implementation
* firestore
